function Ok = UniqueFuncNames()
% Check uniqueness of function names
% If you install a large 3rd party toolbox, the file names may interfere with
% other installed toolboxes. This funtion compares the names of all M-, P- and
% Mex-files found in the Matlab path and displays non-unique names.
%
% P- and Mex-files with the same name as a corresponding M-file are accepted, if
% they are found in the same folder.
% Local subfunctions inside the M- or P-file and nested functions are not taken
% into account, because it is assumed, that a potential shadowing is wanted.
% Class paths as "\@cell" and package paths as "\+mypackage" are not considered
% in this version.
%
% INPUT:  None.
% OUTPUT: Logical flag, TRUE if the names are unique considering some
%   exceptions:
%   1. Files which are intentionally not unique:
%      "Contents.m" exists in each folder.
%      "prefspanel.m" exists in some folder to register control panels.
%      "messageProductNameKey" returns the product key for toolboxes.
%   2. Some user defined folders might contain functions, which are wanted to
%      shadow function of Matlab's or user define toolbox functions, e.g. to
%      improve them. Such folders must be inserted in a leading position in the
%      Matlab path. A further example is a folder, which contains Mex functions,
%      which are compiled for a specific Matlab version, e.g. if you run Matlab
%      6.5 (DLL) and 7 (MEXW32) simulataneously.
%   3. Further exceptions occur e.g. in Matlab 2009a:
%      \R2009a\toolbox\matlab\lang\function.m
%      \R2009a\toolbox\compiler\function.m
%      Exclude one of them using the full file name including the path.
%   The exceptions depend on your installed toolboxes and have to be adjusted to
%   your machine. The corresponding lines are marked by '###' in the source.
%
% NOTE: Modern Matlab versions display warnings, if a folder is added to the
%   path contains naming conflicts with built-in functions.
%   This function does not find all conflicts, e.g. for class paths. I'd
%   appreciate all comments and ideas for improvements and additions.

% Tested: Matlab 6.5, 7.7, 7.8

% Global Interface: ------------------------------------------------------------
% Matlab version considering the number 7.10, which is not 7.1:
MatlabV = round(sscanf(version, '%f', 1) * 100);

% Folders containing functions, which replace other functions intentionally:
% Examples:
% - Folder containing improved versions of Matlab's toolbox functions. Here this
%   is the folder inside the "Patch" folder.
% - Folders containing Mex functions compiled for different Matlab versions,
%   e.g. to avoid confusions between DLL and MEXW32 files.
%
% [ExcludeFolder] must be a {1 x N} cell string, absolute or relative path names,
% no trailing file separator: e.g. 'D:\MFiles\Tools\PatchMatlab76' or
% '\PatchMatlab76'.
% ### PATHS WITH INTENTIONAL SHADOWING -- PLEASE ADJUSTED TO YOUR MACHINE ###

% Contents.m exists in each folder and some function names are intentionally not
% unique. [ExcludeFile] must be a {1 x N} cell string of function names without
% file extension.
